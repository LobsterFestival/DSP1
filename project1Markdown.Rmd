## Overview
In this project we are analysing car crash data from Montgomery County, MD


## Initial Cleaning
```{r echo = TRUE}
dat = read.csv("crashreports.csv")
## FIXME
## data cleaning goes here - removing low-predictor factors etc
dat$dtime = strptime(as.character(dat$Crash.Date.Time),"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz="EST")
```


## Time Analysis

```{r echo = TRUE}
## Crashes by Days of the Week
dayTable = table(dat$dtime$wday)
par(las=2,mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(dayTable, main ="Crashes: Day of Week (2015-2018)", names.arg = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),col = "green")
monthTable = table(dat$dtime$mon)
barplot(monthTable, main="Crashes: By Month (2015-2018)",names.arg = month.name)
##FIXME make these plots pretty af
