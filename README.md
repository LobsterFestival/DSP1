# Data Science Project 1
Montgomery County MD Data Science Project

This was a project for my Data Science Course at CSUMB which involved doing some basic data analysis on car crash data from Montgomery County in Maryland. My partner and I looked at several different metrics and examined some of the different relationships in the 65000+ records. This was one of the first times we worked with a larger sized data set and were given free reign on the patterns we wanted to look for or uncover.
